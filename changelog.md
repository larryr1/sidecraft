# Changelog
## Beta 5
* Beta 5 introduces a license agreement button, changelog button, and an improved launch system.
- Previously, Sidecraft was hardcoded to use filepaths that only work on Windows (using hardcoded backslashes instead of parsing the path) resulting in the inability to launch on Linux [Error discovered on Pop!_OS 21.10])
* The license states that you must own a copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to use Sidecraft. This is fixed in Beta 5.
* The launch button will now be disabled and the launcher will hide until the game closes, like the real Minecraft launcher.
