# sidecraft
Executable-independent Java implementation of a custom Minecraft Launcher.

## Backstory
My school computers block unknown executables, meaning the normal Minecraft launcher wouldn't work on them. However, they had Java installed! By writing a custom launcher in Java, I was essentially able to bypass that restriction.

Sidecraft was originally only accessible by launching it in a terminal, but it was cumbersome to launch Powershell ISE (only allowed terminal) and launch the game. I wanted non-tech-savvy students to be able to use Sidecraft, so that prompted me to turn it into a Swing-GUI-based program.

This project also motivated me because it's my first real Java creation thats functional and practical to use (kinda). C# was not an option (the executable firewall), Node.JS was not installed and neither was Python.

## Releases
No releases yet! I'm still working on it. I need to change some things around so I can distribute it without breaking any copyright laws. People have done the same thing as me at my school, but they were technically distributing pirated versions of the game so they got in trouble. I will not be bundling the game JAR file in any releases.

Also, there are some *huuuuuuuge* security vulnerabilities that need fixing. Oops ðŸ˜Š.
